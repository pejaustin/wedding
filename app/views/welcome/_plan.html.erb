        <h2>Dress code</h2>
        <p><strong>Garden Party Formal</strong></p>
        <p>Dress in your best, but be prepared to spend some time outside, including dinner with the sun setting over the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>We recommend bringing warm shawls and jackets, as May is still a cooler month in the Hudson Valley.</p>

        <h2>Gifts &amp; Cards</h2>
        <p>We'd be pleased if you made a donation to charity rather than bringing a gift. Our goal is to raise $5,000 for <%= link_to 'Palestinian Children\'s relief fund', @pcrf_url %>, who are working to get specialized medical and surgical care for palestinian children injured in the war on Gaza.</p>
        <p class="text-center"><%= link_to 'Donate to PCRF', @pcrf_url, class: 'btn btn-primary wedding-cta-btn' %></p>
        <p>If you'd like to send us a card, we'll send you our mailing address by email once you RSVP.</p>
        <h2>Menu</h2>
        <p>Dinner will be family style&mdash;no need to pick options, there will be something for everyone!</p>
        <h2>RSVPs and Plus-Ones</h2>
        <p>If you are staying with us at the venue, we only have room for the plus-ones we have explicitly invited. If this is the case, please have them RSVP separately. If you or your invited plus-one can't make it, please let us know as soon as possible.</p>
